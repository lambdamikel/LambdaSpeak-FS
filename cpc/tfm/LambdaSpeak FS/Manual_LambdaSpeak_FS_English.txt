Before you use this RSX expansion, you shall use the command |LSINIT (English mode) or 
|LSINIC (Catalan/Spanish Mode).



LambdaSpeak FS Speech Synthesizer, Drum Machine, Sample Player, Real-Time-Clock and MP3/WAV Player
==================================================================================================

This is a new generation speech synthesizer which emulates/simulates the following expansions:

- EPSOM mode    / - These modes provide different voices and can even sing!
- DECtalk mode /
- dk'tronics SPEECH synthesizer
- Amstrad SSA1 synthesizer
- Amdrum drum kit
- MP3 player
- PCM / WAV player
- Real-Time-Clock
- Serial high speed interface (5 volt)
- MIDI (with little expansion cars, connected via serial connection)

It's a defined advantage to put the LambdaSpeak on the Mother X4 Board, because this way
you can use an ROM expansion (like the M4, X-MEM, etc.) for the substantial RSX ROM.

Commands to control LambdaSpeak FS
----------------------------------

Attention: One of the two following commands shall be used before you can use the power of LambdaSpeak FS

|LSINIT: Initializes the LambdaSpeak FS when using the LambdaSpeak FS ROMs. The following steps are carried out: 
         The passing of parameters is switched to 'fast' (using |GETFAST), the language is set to English (|ENGLISH), 
         the Blocking is set to OFF (|BLOCKOFF), the mode is set to Epson (|LAMBDA) and the speech delay is set to a 
         minimum (20 ms) (|SETDELAY,1).

|LSINIC: Initializes the LambdaSpeak FS when using the LambdaSpeak FS ROMs. The following steps are carried out: 
         The passing of parameters is switched to 'fast' (using |GETFAST), the language is set to Spanish (|SPANISH), 
         the Blocking is set to OFF (|BLOCKOFF), the mode is set to Epson (|LAMBDA) and the speech delay is set to a 
         minimum (20 ms) (|SETDELAY,1).

|RESET.: This is like to switch OFF and ON the LambdaSpeak FS. It switches LambdaSpeak FS into the dk'tronics mode.

|STOP..: Stops the current output of language (only in non blocking mode).
         Attention: You need to completely unblock the LambdaSpeak FS using |BLOCKOFF and |XBLKOFF before using |STOP.

|WAIT..: Waits until LambdaSpeak FS is ready. This means port &FBEE equals &20 or &80.



Commands to select the LambdaSpeak FS mode
------------------------------------------

|LAMBDA...: Selects the powerful Epson mode.

|DECTALK..: Selects the DECtalk mode, it can even sing songs.

|SSA1.....: Switches to the Amstrad SSA-1 mode. The LambdaSpeak FS now emulates the Amstrad SSA-1 speech synthesizer.

|DKTRONICS: Switches to the dk'tronics mode. The LambdaSpeak FS now emulates the dk'tronics SPEECH synthesizer.

|AMDRUM...: Switches to the Amdrum mode. The LambdaSpeak FS now emulates the AMDRUM drum system.
            This mode needs to be activated when using the RSX commands |PLAY and |EPLAY to play Amdrum samples.
            Attention: This mode can be left by using |ADEXIT. You need firmware version 5 or higher for |ADEXIT.

|ADEXIT...: Exits the AMDRUM Mode and performes a reset of the LambdaSpeak



Commands to select parameters of the LambdaSpeak FS expansion
-------------------------------------------------------------

|SETVOLUME,0-15: Sets the volume to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard volume.

|SETVOICE,0-15: Sets the voice to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard voice.

|SETSPEED,0-15: Sets the speed of speaking to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard speaking speed.

|SETDELAY,0-15: Sets the delay to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard delay.
                With the 'delay' the time is indicated, which will pass before the LS starts talking after 
                sending the last character to it.

|ENGLISH: Switches the language to English.

|SPANISH: Switches the language to Spanish.

|BLOCKON and |BLOCKOFF: These two commands switch the 'Blocking' on and off for 'User content'.
                        If the 'Blocking' is switched on, then the LambdaSpeak FS will HALT the CPC until
                        all characters have been spoken and the LambdaSpeak FS is ready again.

|XBLKON and |XBLKOFF: These two commands switch 'Blocking' on and off for 'Confirmations'.
                      If the 'X Blocking' is switched on, then the LambdaSpeak FS will HALT the CPC until
                      the actual 'Confirmation' was spoken and the LambdaSpeak FS is ready again.

|CONFON and |CONFOFF: These two commands switch the 'Conformations' on and off. If the 'Conformations' are switche on,
                      the LambdaSpeak FS will tell you all alterations (f.e. mode, language etc.) acoustically.

|GETFAST, |GETMED and |GETSLOW: These commands influence the length of the time span the LambdaSpeak FS will provide 
                                parameters on the bus for the CPC. The LSFS shows data for 10 us, 50 us or 20 ms.
                                For quick machine code the 'fast' mode should be used. As for FutureOS. 10 us.
                                For regular machine code the 'medium' mode should be used. As for the RSX commands. 50 us.
                                For BASIC programs (using IN and OUT commands) the mode should be switched to 'slow' = 20 ms.

Hardware of the LambdaSpeak FS
==============================
More about this great piece of hardware can be found here: 
https://github.com/lambdamikel/LambdaSpeak



DIP switches
------------

The DIP switches can be used to set the configuration
-----------------------------------------------------
The DIP switches are use in the following way: Up = On / Down = Off. 
From left to right = 1 to 8:

1 = Left channel Speech ....................... On
2 = Left channel PCM (Amdrum) ................. Off
3 = Left channel into the CPC (Sound Input) ... On

4 = Right channel Speech.. .................... Off
5 = Right channel PCM (Amdrum) ................ On
6 = Right channel into the CPC (Sound Input) .. On

7 = Segment-LED bar On / Off .................. On
8 = MP3 On / Off .............................. On
    (maybe not needed, because the MP3 modul and MIDI modul work at the same time.
    However, this switch may be needed for other serial applicatons)


Factory settings of the DIP switches
------------------------------------
Nr.:12345678
On.:X X XXXX
Off: X X



Updates / Version 3.12
----------------------
2021.03.01: Command '|ADEXIT' to exit Amdrum mode added. Prodatrons Digitrakker 1.4 for Amdrum mode adapted.
